## How to use:

Make sure you have <a href="https://graphviz.org/download/"> Graphviz </a> installed in your system and added to System PATH. 

and for necessary Python Libraries, simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now open terminal(in the same folder) and run:

```bash
python convert.py "REGEX"
```

replace the <i>REGEX</i> with the actual Regular Expression you want to generate the table and graph for.

<b>NOTE: No guarantee that the code works for all types of regular expressions, but works for most of them.</b>
